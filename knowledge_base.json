The major core infrastructure components are State Data Centres (SDCs), State Wide Area Networks (S.W.A.N), Common Services Centres (CSCs) and middleware gateways i.e National e-Governance Service Delivery Gateway (NSDG), State e-Governance Service Delivery Gateway (SSDG), and Mobile e-Governance Service Delivery Gateway (MSDG). The important support components include Core policies and guidelines on Security, HR, Citizen Engagement, Social Media as well as Standards related to Metadata, Interoperability, Enterprise Architecture, Information Security etc. New initiatives include a framework for authentication, viz. e-Pramaan and G-I cloud, an initiative which will ensure benefits of cloud computing for e-Governance projects. Support components in e-Governance encompass core policies and guidelines on Security, HR, Citizen Engagement, Social Media, as well as standards related to Metadata, Interoperability, Enterprise Architecture, and Information Security. These support components ensure the smooth operation and adherence to best practices in e-Governance initiatives."

      "answer": "Aadhaar-Digital Biometric Identity Infrastructure\n\nThe Aadhaar System is built on a sound strategy and a strong technology backbone and has evolved into a vital digital identity infrastructure. Aadhaar, being a unique digital ID – provides a powerful platform for authenticating a resident anytime and anywhere which is in line with the vision of the UIDAI. The purpose of Authentication is to enable residents to prove their identity and for service providers to confirm that the residents are 'who they say they are' in order to supply services and give access to benefits.\n\nEnrolment & Update Ecosystem\n\nEnrolment Ecosystem consists of Registrars and Enrolment Agencies. Registrar is an entity authorised or recognized by UIDAI for the purpose of enrolling individuals. Enrolment Agencies are appointed by Registrars and are responsible for collecting demographic and biometric information of individuals during the enrolment process by engaging certified Operators/Supervisors.\n\nAuthentication Ecosystem\n\nThe UIDAI has set up a scalable ecosystem for the purpose of instant authentication of residents. The Aadhaar authentication ecosystem is capable of handling tens of millions of authentications on a daily basis, and can be scaled up further as per the demand. The UIDAI has appointed a number of Authentication Service Agencies (ASAs) and Authentication User Agencies (AUAs) from various Government and non-Government organisations.\n\nRegistered Biometric Devices\n\nThe UIDAI, in partnership with STQC, has also laid down the technical standards for biometric devices, and certified a number of them to enhance the security level. UIDAI has taken several security measures to ensure security of transactions and end to end traceability during the authentication process to make it more robust and secure. UIDAI, along with biometric device vendors and STQC, is working on the concept of Registered devices. UIDAI vide their letter no dt 25.01.2017 have directed to all their AUA/ ASAs to ask their device vendors to ensure the upgrade of existing biometric devices to registered devices by 1st June 2017."
